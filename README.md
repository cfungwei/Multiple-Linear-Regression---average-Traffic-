# Multiple-Linear-Regression---average-Traffic

The dataset presents us with 121 observations, 4 predictor variables and 1 response variables. 

1.  Y - Average annual daily traffic (aadt) (Response Variable)
2. X1 - Population of county in which road section is located
3. X2 - Number of lanes in road section
4. X3 - Width of road section (ft)
5. X4 - Two-category quality variable indicating whether or not there is control of access to road section

Data had no missing values and target variables were already isolated. We proceed with a scatter plot matrix to identify a correlation between variables but the plot below seems to no have any observable pattern. *Looking back, using a scatter plot on categorical data might not be as effective as using a boxplot on each level of the factor. This can help us visualize if there is a direct correlation between the levels and increasing aadt. An increase in the quartiles and median would convince me of an existing correlation*

Modelling and Adequacy Testing
---
Multiple Adequacy testing will be used: F-test, t-test, R<sup>2</sup> statistic, residual plots, normality checking (non-constant variances and higher order curvatures) ([QQ-plot](https://towardsdatascience.com/q-q-plots-explained-5aa8495426c0)) and sequential checking ([durbin-watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durbin%E2%80%93Watson_statistic))

To see the entire process, the [code](https://github.com/fungiiiii/Multiple-Linear-Regression---average-Traffic-/blob/main/main) can be accessed here.Our final model will be y<sup>Î»</sup> = X1 + X2 + X1X2 + X1X4

Above are the results for the F-test, T-test and R<sup>2</sup> statistic where we find that we reject the null hypothesis for both test and find that both model and variables are significant. Furhtermore, R<sup>2</sup> statistic is at 0.8614 which implies the model fits the train set well.

From the above array of plots, the variance for residual plots seem to show no patterns and residual plots have a constant variance. QQ plot identifies the normality of the model and the plot indicates that the model likely follows a normal plot with little skew.

Image above shows that the durbin-watson p-value is at 0.04912. We would be required to reduce our significance level from 0.99 to 0.95 such that it will not reject the model that it is sequentially correlated.

In conclusion, our final model fits the best compared to the previous models to predict the annual average daily traffic.
